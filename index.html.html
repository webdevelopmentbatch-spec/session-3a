    <hr>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Education is the <strong>most powerful tool</strong> that helps in shaping the <u>future</u> of students. 
        It allows them to <em>develop skills</em>, <b>gain knowledge</b>, and <span style="color:blue;">grow intellectually</span>. 
        <br>
        A good education opens doors to opportunities and helps individuals make better decisions in life.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Education Matters</h2>
    <p>
        <i>Education</i> teaches us how to think critically, communicate effectively, and behave responsibly in society.
        <br>It is not just about learning from books but about <em>developing values</em> and understanding the <b>importance of discipline</b>.
        <br><br>
        As <abbr title="United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</abbr> states,
        <q>Education is a human right with immense power to transform.</q>
    </p>

    <h3>Benefits of Being Educated</h3>
    <p>
        An educated person contributes positively to society. Education improves <u>self-confidence</u> and helps students 
        to <ins>achieve their goals</ins> while avoiding <del>bad habits</del> that destroy their potential.
        <br><br>
        It enhances creativity and helps people solve real-life problems effectively.
        For example, students learn that success can be represented by this simple formula:
        <br>
        <b>Success</b> = <em>Hard Work</em><sup>2</sup> + <i>Consistency</i><sub>daily</sub>
    </p>

    <h2>Role of Teachers and Parents</h2>
    <p>
        Teachers and parents play a <strong>crucial role</strong> in shaping the education of a child. 
        They guide students to differentiate between <i>right and wrong</i> and inspire them to 
        <u>believe in themselves</u>.
        <br><br>
        According to <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>, emotional support from family and school 
        increases a student’s ability to learn effectively.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” 
        — <strong>Nelson Mandela</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        In conclusion, education is not only about acquiring degrees or certificates; 
        it’s about <em>developing wisdom</em> and <strong>becoming a better human being</strong>.
        <br>
        <span style="color:green;">Every student</span> must understand that learning never ends — 
        <q>each day brings a new lesson.</q>
        <br><br>
        A nation with educated citizens is a <b>strong and progressive nation</b>.
